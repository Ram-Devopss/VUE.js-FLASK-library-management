# Library Management System

This project is a library management system with a **Vue.js** frontend and **Flask** backend. It features two types of user accounts: **Student** and **Librarian**. The website is designed with a clever and aesthetically pleasing interface to enhance user experience.

## Project Features

- **Two Types of Accounts:**
  - **Student Account:**
    - Register and log in with an individual account.
    - View all available books with detailed descriptions.
    - Download PDF versions of books.
    - Rent books by specifying the rental duration.
  - **Librarian Account:**
    - View statistics including:
      - Total number of students.
      - Total number of books.
      - Number of rental requests.
    - Manage rental requests by either granting or denying them.
    - Add new books to the library.
    - Modify existing book details.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm** installed on your system for the frontend.
- **Python** installed on your system, preferably using a virtual environment for the backend.
- Required packages installed for both npm and Python.

### Installation

1. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm run serve
     ```
   - This will start the Vue.js development server.

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Minimize the terminal running the frontend server.
   - Open another terminal or command prompt in the same project folder.
   - Navigate to the backend directory and activate your Python virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start the Flask server by typing:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Database Setup (if needed):**
   - If you need to modify or recreate the database file, stop the running `main.py` server.
   - Run the following command to automatically create the database file:
     ```bash
     python create_db.py
     ```
   - Make sure to delete the old database file located in the `backend/instance` folder before running the above command.

### Notes:
- Ensure that you always start the backend using the virtual environment.
- For any modifications in the database structure, the existing database file should be deleted to prevent conflicts.

## Project Design

This library management system is designed with a user-friendly interface and a responsive layout, making it accessible on various devices. The system is built to handle multiple user types with specific functionalities, ensuring a smooth and efficient library management experience.
